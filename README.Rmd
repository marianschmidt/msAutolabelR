# msAutolabelleR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of msAutolabelleR is to automate labelling introduced by the sjlabelled package, which provides very helpful functions 
on labelling dataframes.
This package provides helper functions to automatically label existing dataframes using an external
Excel-Table that defines variable labels and formats.

## Installation

You can install the released version of msAutolabelleR from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("msAutolabelleR")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("marianschmidt/msAutolabelleR")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(msAutolabelleR)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.
